This website, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, focuses on the topic of reference, which deals with how language refers to objects or properties. It discusses different types of referential terms such as names and how they relate to the act of referring. The site explores questions like how terms come to refer, the relationship between reference and meaning, and how language is used to talk about the world. It's a great resource for understanding the philosophical aspects of linguistic reference.
