## A Search Engine for the Elderly Made Easy

### What it does

Rondo is an AI-powered search-engine tool that makes the Internet truly accessible for the elderly population. Rondo takes in a query input from the user like any other regular old search engine. However, based off the specificity of the query, Rondo will prompt the user to answer a specific, well defined multiple choice question related to the original query in order to generate a more specific, better defined search query with more tailored results.

### How we built it

For the frontend, we used Reflex -- an open-source framework for building web applications in pure python. For the backend, we leveraged Python along with the OpenAI API, constructing prompts to elicit relevant responses, and dynamically updating queries based on iterative user input.
